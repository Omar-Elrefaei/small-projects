# Small Projects
Small miscellaneous programs I wrote for various purposes.

## Files
- `Electric_Field.jl`: A lab report written as a Julia notebook[^1] for my electromagnetism course. ([Preview](https://omar-elrefaei.github.io/lab1-Electric_Field.jl.html))
- `material-science.r`: An R script to extract and plot material properties (such as Tensile strength and Young's modulus) from the laboratory obtained stress-strain data.




[^1]: [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) is an extremely good alternative to Jupyter notebooks for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language
