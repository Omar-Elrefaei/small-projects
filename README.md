# Small Projects
Small miscellaneous programs I wrote for various purposes.

## Files
- `Lab1-Electric_Field.jl`: Lab report written as a Julia/Pluto notebook[^1] for my ECE106 Electromagnetism course. ([Here is a preview](https://omar-elrefaei.github.io/lab1-Electric_Field.jl.html))
- `material-science.r`: An R script to extract and plot material properties (such as Yield/Tensile strengths and Young's modulus) from Stress-Strain data obtained from a material science laboratory.
